# roam-outer-space-theme

Theme I use for all my note taking apps ported to Roam (mostly colors tbh). Highly unpolished. Feel free to contribute.

This theme is heavily based on the excellent (and highly polished) [better-roam-research](https://github.com/linuz90/better-roam-research) theme.

## How to use

1. Create a page named `roam/css` (it must be named this way).
2. Create a css block with ```.
3. Copy and paste the contents of `roam-outer-space.css` file or add an `@import` rule.
